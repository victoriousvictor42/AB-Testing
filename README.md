# A/B Testing
#### Covering the process of A/B Testing, 28/8/2021
#### By **Victor Mwenda**
## Description
In this notebook we'll go over the process of analysing an A/B test, from formulating a hypothesis, testing it, and finally interpreting results. For our data, we'll use a dataset from Kaggle which contains the results of an A/B test on what seems to be 2 different designs of a website page (old_page vs. new_page). Here's what we'll do:
* Designing our experiment
* Collecting and preparing the data
* Visualising the results
* Testing the hypothesis
* Drawing conclusions

To make it a bit more realistic, here's a potential scenario for our study:

Let's imagine you work on the product team at a medium-sized online e-commerce business. The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of 2%, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.

Before rolling out the change, the team would be more comfortable testing it on a small number of users to see how it performs, so you suggest running an A/B test on a subset of your user base users.
